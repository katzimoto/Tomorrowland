## 2026-05-29 — feat(intelligence): LLM provider abstraction (#528)

Status: Done — PR open
Source: issue #528, Claude Code session

**Goal:** Allow operators to use any OpenAI-compatible local inference server (LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM) instead of Ollama-only for LLM generation. Air-gapped first; no openai SDK.

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/intelligence/llm_provider.py` (new) — `LLMProvider` Protocol, `OpenAICompatibleLLMProvider`, standalone `parse_json_array()`
- `src/services/intelligence/factory.py` (new) — `build_llm_provider(settings)`
- `src/services/intelligence/__init__.py` — exports `LLMProvider`, `OpenAICompatibleLLMProvider`, `build_llm_provider`
- `src/services/intelligence/worker.py` — `OllamaClient` → `LLMProvider` type; `parse_json_array` from module
- `src/services/rag/reranker.py`, `rag/service.py`, `chat/message_service.py` — type hints updated
- `src/services/api/main.py` — `ollama_client` param → `llm_provider`; `app.state.llm_provider` set from factory
- `src/services/api/routers/chat.py`, `admin/intelligence.py` — use `app.state.llm_provider`
- `src/services/pipeline/runner.py`, `slow_worker.py`, `intelligence_consumer.py` — use `build_llm_provider(settings)`
- `src/shared/config.py` — `llm_provider`, `llm_base_url`, `llm_model` fields added
- `.env.example` — `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL` commented block added
- `tests/unit/test_llm_provider.py` (new) — 18 tests

**Key constraint:** `generate_stream` is in the protocol; `OpenAICompatibleLLMProvider` raises `NotImplementedError` for streaming (OpenAI SSE format out of scope per issue). Streaming chat endpoint only works with `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`.

**Verification:** ruff clean, mypy strict clean (8 files), 18 new + 36 existing related unit tests pass.

**Next agent prompt:**
> Pick up issue #529 (ingestion pipeline debug status page) or #530 (citation grounding). Both are status:next and unblocked.

## 2026-05-28 — dist: v0.2.0 air-gapped release artifact

Status: Active — files ready; CI build required before distributing
Source: Claude Code session

**Goal:** Produce a deployment-ready `dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0/` replacing `v1.0-rc3` with correct version, new models (qwen3.5:35b-a3b, qwen3:14b, qwen3-embedding:8b), and split-Ollama compose.

**Changed files in `dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0/`:**
- `release-manifest.json` — v0.2.0, 16ff0ab, v0.2.0 image tags, 3-bundle section, split ollama volumes
- `docker-compose.airgap.yml` — ollama → ollama-llm + ollama-embed; EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama default
- `.env.airgap.example` — version stamp, EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama
- `README-airgap.txt` — all 3 bundles, correct containers and sizes
- `docs/air-gapped-deployment.md` — full mistral → qwen3.5:35b-a3b sweep; 3-bundle table; port 11435 for embed validation
- `docs/air-gapped-upgrade.md` — 3-bundle upgrade path; per-container validation commands; ollama_llm/embed volume names
- `docs/production-compose.md` — volume table split; pull commands per container
- `scripts/validate-ollama-model.sh` — default model → qwen3.5:35b-a3b
- `scripts/load-ollama-model-bundle.sh` — usage updated for --compose-service
- `checksums.txt` — regenerated

**New bundle metadata dirs:**
- `dist/tomorrowland-ollama-bundle-qwen3.5-35b-a3b-v0.2.0/` (model-manifest.json + README)
- `dist/tomorrowland-ollama-bundle-qwen3-14b-v0.2.0/` (model-manifest.json + README)
- `dist/tomorrowland-ollama-bundle-qwen3-embedding-8b-v0.2.0/` (model-manifest.json + README)

**Verification:** Zero stale `mistral`/`v1.0-rc3`/`ollama_data`/`nomic-embed-text`/`mxbai-embed-large` strings in any text file in the release directory. 138 occurrences of correct v0.2.0/qwen3/ollama-llm/ollama-embed strings confirmed.

**Remaining (CI/build-time):**
1. Build and tag Docker images as `tomorrowland/backend:v0.2.0`, `frontend:v0.2.0`, `libretranslate:v0.2.0`.
2. Re-bundle `images/tomorrowland-images.tar` containing the v0.2.0-tagged images.
3. `sha256sum images/tomorrowland-images.tar >> dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0/checksums.txt`
4. `tar czf dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0.tar.gz -C dist tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0/`
5. `sha256sum dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0.tar.gz > dist/tomorrowland-release-v0.2.0.tar.gz.sha256`
6. Split image tar into 1900m parts: `split -b 1900m images.tar tomorrowland-images-v0.2.0.tar.part-`
7. Bundle each model dir into its `.tar.gz` and compute `.sha256`.

**Operator note — upgrading from rc3:**
- `ollama` service is now two services (`ollama-llm` + `ollama-embed`). Volumes renamed: `ollama_data` → `ollama_llm_data` + `ollama_embed_data`. Models must be re-loaded into both containers after upgrade.
- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama` is now the default in `.env.airgap.example` (was empty).

**Next agent prompt:**
> Run the CI build pipeline for v0.2.0: build and tag Docker images, bundle images/tomorrowland-images.tar, update checksums.txt with the image tar hash, produce the platform archive and split parts, and bundle each of the 3 model directories into their .tar.gz files with .sha256 companions.

## 2026-05-28 — refactor(pipeline): enforce extraction boundary — only parse/worker may call .extract()

Status: Done — pushed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Goal:** No worker or service outside the designated extraction stage may call `ExtractorRegistry.extract()` directly. All non-extractor callers must read pre-extracted text from `document_payloads`.

**Changes (7 files):**
- `pipeline/vector_worker.py`: removed `extractor` param from `run_vector_once`/`run_vector_loop`; removed fallback extraction block; removed `ExtractorRegistry` import.
- `pipeline/slow_worker.py`: removed `extractor_registry` constructor param and `self._extractor`; `process_document`/`_run`/`_run_versioned`/`_run_legacy` now accept `content_text: str = ""`; `run_enrich_once` fetches payload and passes `content_text` down.
- `related/service.py`: replaced `extractor_registry` constructor param with `job_repo: PipelineJobRepository`; `related_documents` reads `content_text` from payload.
- `api/routers/documents.py`: both `RelatedService(...)` calls pass `job_repo=PipelineJobRepository(connection)`.
- `api/routers/alerts.py`: admin re-match endpoint reads payload instead of calling extractor.
- `api/routers/admin/intelligence.py`: both trigger + summary-regenerate endpoints read payload.
- `tests/unit/test_slow_worker.py`: `_FakeEnrichRepo` gains `get_payload()`; assertion updated.

**Intentional exception:** `preview/service.py:302` — last-resort fallback after payload check fails, guarded by file-exists check, intentional for pre-pipeline uploads.

**Verification:** 8/8 slow-worker unit tests pass; zero `.extract()` calls outside `extraction/`, `pipeline/worker.py`, `pipeline/parse_worker.py`.

## 2026-05-27 — feat(extraction): uniform ExtractionResult envelope — commit 5e46f1f

Status: Done — pushed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Goal:** Pipeline workers fully agnostic to file type — no `hasattr(extractor, "extract_attachments")` branch anywhere.

**Changes:**
- `base.py`: `ExtractionResult(text: str, attachments: list[AttachmentData] = [])` dataclass; `Extractor` protocol returns `ExtractionResult`.
- `__init__.py`: exports `ExtractionResult`.
- Container extractors (eml, msg_extractor, zip_extractor, tar_extractor): single-pass extraction — body text + attachment bytes in one file-open block; public `extract_attachments()` method removed.
- 16 non-container extractors: `return ExtractionResult(text=...)`.
- `registry.py`: `extract() -> ExtractionResult`; sniff-and-retry checks `result.text`.
- `pipeline/worker.py`: unpacks `result.text` + `result.attachments`; `hasattr` branch gone; `_extraction_result: ExtractionResult | None = None` guards attachment path (None when `pre_extracted_text` bypasses file extraction).
- `pipeline/parse_worker.py`, `slow_worker.py`, `vector_worker.py`, `related/service.py`, `preview/service.py`, `alerts.py`, `intelligence.py`: `.text` suffix added.
- All 25 extraction + pipeline unit test files updated to `.text` assertions.

**Verification:** 204 unit tests pass; mypy 0 new errors (8 pre-existing import-untyped warnings in unchanged files).

## 2026-05-27 — fix(frontend): 5 UX bugs across documents, chat, admin, and annotations

Status: Done — pushed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Bugs fixed (4 files):**

1. **`FidelityStatusBar.tsx` — silent download failure** — "download original" button had no `.catch()`; added `r.ok` check and `showToast("error", …)` on failure.
2. **`InsightPane.tsx` (AnnotationsTab) — no Enter-to-submit** — annotation input lacked `onKeyDown`; inconsistent with `CommentComposer`/`AnnotationEditor`. Added Enter handler guarded by non-empty + not-pending.
3. **`AdminAddSourceWizard.tsx` — empty array treated as loading** — `!connectorTypes.length` was the loading gate; a system with zero connectors would show "Loading…" forever. Changed to `isLoading: connectorTypesLoading` from `useQuery`.
4. **`ChatWindow.tsx` — no retry on session load error** — error state rendered `EmptyState` with no recovery action. Added `variant="secondary"` Button that invalidates the query (uses `t.chat.retry`).
5. **`InsightPane.tsx` cache key mismatch (`["doc-annotations"]` vs `["annotations"]`)** — AnnotationsTab used a different key than `AnnotationList`/`AnnotationEditor`; mutations on one never invalidated the other (up to 2 min stale). Standardized all InsightPane keys to `["annotations", docId]`.

**Verification:** `tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors.

## 2026-05-27 — fix(extraction): generic Office extraction — commit 023f9e0

Status: Done — pushed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Root cause (4 bugs):**

1. **XLS never extracted** — `application/vnd.ms-excel` had no extractor; fell to GenericExtractor which returns `""` for OLE binary files.
2. **DOCX/XLSX/PPTX with wrong stored MIME** — `application/zip` routed to ZipExtractor (returns XML file-listing, not text); `application/octet-stream` routed to GenericExtractor (returns `""`).
3. **Office MIME variants unregistered** — `.docm`, `.dotx`, `.pptm`, `.potx`, `.xltx`, `.xltm`, and `application/msword`-mislabeled DOCX all fell to GenericExtractor.
4. **Settings not wired in 3 workers** — `parse_worker`, `slow_worker`, `vector_worker` created `ExtractorRegistry()` without `enable_ocr`/`enable_legacy_office` from Settings.

**Fix:**
- `xls.py` — new `XlsExtractor` using `xlrd` (pure Python); registered for `application/vnd.ms-excel`. `xlrd>=2.0` in pyproject.toml.
- `mime_detector.py` — new `sniff_office_mime(path)`: reads ZIP contents (stdlib) to identify DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/ODF; detects OLE magic bytes for legacy. Used as last-resort in `detect()`.
- `registry.py` — sniff-and-retry in `extract()` for `application/zip` and `application/octet-stream` (always) and any MIME when result is empty. New aliases for all Office MIME variants.
- `parse_worker`, `slow_worker`, `vector_worker` — pass settings flags to `ExtractorRegistry`.

**Remaining limit:** `.doc` / `.ppt` (binary OLE) still need `ENABLE_LEGACY_OFFICE=true` + LibreOffice. No pure-Python library covers these.

**Tests:** 51 tests pass; 20 new (16 sniffing + 4 XLS). Ruff + mypy --strict clean.

## 2026-05-26 — fix/office-extraction-empty-text — 3-bug sweep (PR #521)

Status: Done — merged to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Root cause:** Three independent bugs all produced empty text for PPTX/DOCX documents.

**Bug 1 — preview snippet from deleted temp files (`src/services/preview/service.py`)**
`_generate_snippet` fell through to file re-extraction when no translation was found. SMB/Atlassian connectors delete the temp file after pipeline processing — file re-extraction always returned `""` even though `content_text` was safely stored in `document_payloads`. Fix: read `document_payloads.content_text` before the file fallback. Primary-key lookup; negligible overhead.

**Bug 2 — content_text lost on retry (`src/services/pipeline/consumer_base.py`)**
The manual retry path (`attempt >= retry_limit`, `< max_attempts`) rebuilt the retry JSON without `content_text`. Translate/embed/index workers all received `content_text=""` on retried messages. Fix: call `job_repo.get_payload(document_id)` in the retry branch and include `content_text` when the payload exists.

**Bug 3 — extractor exception gaps (`src/services/extraction/pptx_extractor.py`, `docx.py`)**
Both caught `(OSError, KeyError, PackageNotFoundError)` but not `zipfile.BadZipFile` or `ValueError`. Corrupted or mis-identified ZIP-based Office files propagated unhandled exceptions. Fix: added `zipfile.BadZipFile` and `ValueError` to both tuples.

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/preview/service.py`
- `src/services/pipeline/consumer_base.py`
- `src/services/extraction/pptx_extractor.py`
- `src/services/extraction/docx.py`
- `tests/unit/test_preview_service.py` (new)
- `tests/unit/test_extraction_pptx.py` (+2 tests)
- `tests/unit/test_extraction_docx.py` (+2 tests)
- `tests/unit/test_consumer_base.py` (+2 tests)

**Verification:** 17/17 targeted tests pass; ruff clean; mypy clean (4 source files, strict).

**Remaining risks:**
- Early retry attempts (attempt < `retry_limit` = `min(3, max_attempts)`) still use `basic_nack` → RabbitMQ DLQ re-route which does not carry `content_text`. Downstream workers can re-read from `document_payloads` if needed.
- `_generate_snippet` now makes one additional primary-key DB query per non-translated preview; negligible at current scale.

## 2026-05-26 — pipeline connector parity — 6-bug sweep

Status: Done — committed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Root cause:** Both ingestion paths (`sync-now` API and scheduler) used hard-coded `connector_type == "smb"` string checks instead of capability-based checks, causing SMB temp files to be deleted too early (before the async worker reads them), Atlassian attachment temp files to leak, RabbitMQ messages to never be published from the scheduler, generator-level exceptions to be silently swallowed, and a logically unreachable `"failed"` sync outcome.

**Bugs fixed:**
1. **Temp file deleted before worker reads it** — `sync-now` called `os.unlink` on `item.path` inside the ingestion loop; the pipeline worker needs the file after the HTTP request returns. Removed the early unlink entirely.
2. **Atlassian temp files leaked** — SMB-only `os.unlink` never ran for Confluence/Jira attachment paths. Moved cleanup into `PipelineWorker._run()` via `_maybe_delete_connector_temp()`: deletes `doc.path` only if it lives under `tempfile.gettempdir()` (SMB + Atlassian), leaves Folder/NiFi staged files alone.
3. **Scheduler never published RabbitMQ messages** — `_sync_source` returned nothing; messages were enqueued in `pipeline_jobs` but never published. Added `_publish_scheduled_rabbit_messages()` mirroring the sync-now API path; refactored `_run_scheduled_syncs` to accept `engine` + `settings` and publish post-commit.
4. **`sync_outcome = "failed"` logically unreachable** — condition was `failed_discovery > 0 and discovered == 0` which can never be true. Fixed to `discovered > 0 and failed_discovery == discovered`.
5. **Generator exception swallowed** — `try/except` wrapped `connector.fetch_documents()` (the call), not the iteration. Since all real connectors are generators, the call always succeeds; mid-iteration errors (page 2 network failure etc.) were uncaught. Moved `try/except` around the `for item in documents:` loop.
6. **NiFi missing from `_classify_connection_error`** — Folder, SMB, Confluence, Jira all had connector-specific error classification; NiFi was absent, defaulting to a generic branch. Added NiFi branch for `staging_root`/`does not exist`/`not a directory` → `config_invalid` and `connection`/`timeout`/`refused` → `unreachable`.

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/api/_helpers.py` — Bug 6: NiFi branch in `_classify_connection_error`
- `src/services/api/routers/admin/ingestion.py` — Bugs 1+4: removed early `os.unlink`; fixed `sync_outcome` condition
- `src/services/pipeline/worker.py` — Bugs 1+2: added `_maybe_delete_connector_temp()`, called after extraction
- `src/services/pipeline/scheduler.py` — Bugs 1+2+3+4+5: refactored to per-source transactions, added RabbitMQ publish, fixed generator iteration guard, fixed `sync_outcome`
- `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` — updated SMB cleanup test (temp files now preserved for worker)
- `tests/unit/test_pipeline_worker.py` — 4 new tests for `_maybe_delete_connector_temp`

**Verification:** 80 unit tests passed, 35 integration tests passed, ruff clean, mypy clean.

**Remaining risks:**
- `_maybe_delete_connector_temp` relies on `Path.is_relative_to(tempfile.gettempdir())`. On systems where a connector writes to a custom temp dir outside `gettempdir()` (e.g. Docker volume mounts), files would not be cleaned up. A future `ConnectorDocument.owned_by_caller: bool` flag would be cleaner.
- NiFi `staging_root` temp files are permanent staged paths — not cleaned up by the new helper (correct behavior: NiFi manages its own staging). No change needed, but worth noting.

**Next agent prompt:**
> Continue the ACL HIGH items from `docs/context/acl-audit.md`: `/search` admin bypass, `/expertise` admin bypass, stub `SearchResultItem`, transitive-group expansion, and `/expertise` subscription leak.

## 2026-05-26 — annotations router — security fixes (delete_reply + list_replies)

Status: Done — committed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/annotations/repository.py` — added `get_reply_by_id()` (returns non-deleted reply by id)
- `src/services/api/routers/annotations.py` — extracted `_get_annotation_or_404_with_access()`; fixed `delete_reply` (missing `assert_doc_access`); fixed `list_replies` (private annotation visibility); refactored `update_annotation`, `delete_annotation`, `create_reply` to use helper
- `tests/integration/test_annotations_api.py` — 2 regression tests: `test_delete_reply_blocked_without_doc_access`, `test_list_replies_hidden_for_private_annotation`

**Verification:** 22 integration tests passed (ruff clean, mypy clean).

**Remaining risks:**
- `create_reply` does not gate on annotation visibility (can reply to a private annotation if you have doc access + know annotation ID). Pre-existing; deliberate policy decision needed before fixing.
- ACL audit HIGH items still open — see current-state.md.

**Next agent prompt:**
> Implement the ACL audit HIGH items from `docs/context/acl-audit.md`: fix `/search` and `/expertise` admin bypass, drop stub `SearchResultItem`, add transitive-group expansion, and tighten the `/expertise` subscription leak. These block the D2 PR.

## 2026-05-26 — fix/extractor-bugs — 15-bug sweep (extractors + translation pipeline)

Status: Merged — main
Source: Claude Code session

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/extraction/html.py` — depth counter for nested skip tags; latin-1 fallback
- `src/services/extraction/rtf.py` — latin-1 fallback for Win-1252 RTF files
- `src/services/extraction/xml_extractor.py` — ET.parse() + itertext() (tag stripping + encoding)
- `src/services/extraction/docx.py` — merged-cell dedup by `_tc` identity
- `src/services/extraction/msg_extractor.py` — `msg.close()` in finally; contextlib.suppress import
- `src/services/extraction/xlsx.py` — `wb.close()` in finally block
- `src/services/extraction/epub.py` — re.DOTALL on `_TAG_RE`
- `src/services/extraction/eml.py` — filename-guessed MIME when no explicit Content-Type
- `src/services/extraction/registry.py` — remove self-alias + dead x-zip-compressed entry
- `src/services/pipeline/translation_worker.py` — graceful skip for empty content_text
- `src/services/pipeline/slow_worker.py` — `type(exc).__name__` in loop error log
- `src/services/pipeline/translate_worker.py` — use doc.target_language (default "en") instead of hardcoded "en"
- `tests/unit/test_extractor_bug_fixes.py` — 20 regression tests (new file; +2 for bug 15)
- `tests/unit/test_translation_worker.py` — 2 tests updated for new graceful-skip behavior

**Verification:** 28/28 targeted tests pass. 28 pre-existing failures in `test_compose_volumes.py` are unrelated.

**Remaining risks:**
- `test_compose_volumes.py` pre-existing failures need a separate fix (airgap compose YAML shape).
- `.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt` (legacy Office) still return empty unless `ENABLE_LEGACY_OFFICE=true`.
- Scanned PDFs still need `ENABLE_OCR=true` for any text extraction.

**Next agent prompt:**
- Consider a backfill job to re-extract documents that had XML, RTF, or HTML files previously returning empty.

## 2026-05-26 — fix: translation sweep — read-path, 6 bugs, TOCTOU race, xlsx, attachments

Status: Done — main, commits 263171c + e0c74fb + ab3e3ac
Source: Claude Code session

All translation bugs found in a systematic audit and fixed across three commits.

**Changed files:**
- `src/services/preview/service.py` — read-path IS DISTINCT FROM guard in all 3 `get_translated_text` branches; atomic INSERT ON CONFLICT in `_maybe_auto_enrich`
- `src/services/documents/repository.py` — `list_versions` LEFT JOIN + no-op exclusion
- `src/services/pipeline/slow_worker.py` — no-op + empty guard in `_run_versioned`
- `src/services/api/routers/documents.py` — `request_translation` RabbitMQ publish + `target_lang or "en"` label fix; download endpoint accepts `translation_version_id`
- `src/services/extraction/xlsx.py` — `data_only=True`, `read_only=True`, broad exception catch
- `src/services/extraction/registry.py` — macro-enabled XLSX aliases; `has_extractor()` method
- `src/services/pipeline/worker.py` — `_process_attachments` uses `has_extractor()` not `get()-is-None`
- `frontend/src/api/documents.ts` — `getDownloadUrl` accepts `translationVersionId`
- `frontend/src/features/documents/DocumentToolbar.tsx` — passes `selectedVersionId` to download
- `frontend/src/features/documents/DocumentPage.tsx` — `"processing"` in polling check
- `frontend/src/features/documents/TranslationVersionSelector.tsx` — `"processing"` in `hasInProgressVersions`
- `migrations/versions/x8y9z0a1b2c3_dtv_unique_active_per_type.py` — partial unique index
- `tests/unit/test_pipeline_worker.py` — `has_extractor()` added to `_FakeExtractorRegistry`

**Verification:** 124 backend unit tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` clean; `ruff check` clean.

**Deploy note:** Migration `x8y9z0a1b2c3` must run before restart — adds partial unique index.

**Remaining watch items:**
- Attachment GC: `files_root/attachments/` grows without bound on doc delete.
- `request_translation` duplicate guard: uses `find_pending_or_running` SELECT then INSERT — not atomic. Lower risk than auto-enrich (user-triggered, not concurrent) but the same partial index now enforces uniqueness at DB level as a backstop.

## 2026-05-26 — fix: translation mode shows original-language text + octet-stream preview

Status: Done — branch feat/design-system-update, commits 0c10cca + 0947937 (pushed)
Source: Claude Code session

Three translation bugs fixed and one preview improvement made:

**1. Navigation reset (frontend — DocumentPage.tsx, TranslationVersionSelector.tsx)**
- `selectedVersionId` was not cleared on `docId` change; `TranslationVersionSelector` `if (selectedVersionId !== undefined) return` guard blocked auto-selection on every doc after the first.
- Fix: reset `selectedVersionId(undefined)` + `hadInProgressRef.current` in docId effect; add docId-keyed effect in selector resetting `initialSelectDoneRef` + `hadInProgressRef`.

**2. Empty-translation fallback (backend — src/services/pipeline/runner.py)**
- `_version_text = translated or extracted` — when translation returned `""`, a version was created with `translated_text = extracted_text` (original-language text). Translation tab showed source language.
- Fix: `_version_text = translated_text` only; empty → no version → tab hidden. Added info log. Unit test `test_translation_version_skipped_when_translated_is_empty` updated (was asserting buggy behavior).

**3. No-op synthetic version (backend — src/services/api/routers/documents.py)**
- After df93072 no-op detection, `document_payloads.translated_text = content_text` for no-op docs; synthetic fallback had no guard → translation tab appeared with original text.
- Fix: `AND dp.translated_text IS DISTINCT FROM dp.content_text` in fallback WHERE clause.

**4. application/octet-stream preview (frontend — PreviewPane.tsx, GenericPreview.tsx)**
- "Cannot be previewed" error wall replaced with extension-based routing (CODE_EXTENSIONS, TEXT_EXTENSIONS, MD_EXTENSIONS) and `GenericPreview` fallback showing extracted text + MIME banner + download link.
- New file: `src/features/documents/renderers/GenericPreview.tsx`.

Verification: `tsc --noEmit` clean; 21 pipeline runner unit tests pass; 5 pre-existing frontend test failures unchanged.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Existing documents in DB with `translated_text = content_text` in `document_translation_versions` (created before df93072) still surface as "available" via the real version record — `get_translated_text` returns original text. A data-cleanup pass or `get_translated_text` guard would close this edge case.
- Attachment GC still missing (files_root/attachments/ grows without bound on doc delete).

## 2026-05-26 — feat: design system update — search + document UI

Status: Done — commit c62094d on feat/design-system-update (pushed, PR ready)
Source: Tomorrowland Design System.zip + Claude Code session

Changed files (all pass tsc + vite build, zero errors):
- `frontend/src/features/search/ResultRow.tsx` — source label moved to left column as `<Badge variant="source">`; tags, overflow count, version, translation quality all use `<Badge>` instead of dot-separated inline spans
- `frontend/src/features/search/ResultRow.module.css` — left column is column-direction to stack mime icon + source badge; snippet expands to 2 lines; meta row uses gap tokens; preview button always visible; highlight marks use oklch amber tint
- `frontend/src/features/search/SearchPage.module.css` — active mode button gets `box-shadow`; keyboard help bar gains `border-bottom`, bg token, `font-size-meta`
- `frontend/src/features/documents/InsightPane.module.css` — section headings get `text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.04em`
- `frontend/src/features/documents/DocumentPage.module.css` — insight column `min-width: 360px → 300px` per spec

Design system zip coverage: all 52 zip files now match project. One valid exception: InsightPane.module.css retains `.dotList` / `.dotList .item` / `.dotList .sep` classes used by InsightPane.tsx that the zip snapshot predates.

Known follow-up:
- `.left` column is `width: 36px` with a `white-space: nowrap` source badge — long source labels (e.g. "Confluence") will visually overflow. Widening to `fit-content` or adding `overflow: hidden` is a safe follow-up if it causes layout collisions in practice.

## 2026-05-25 — fix: translation no-op + download JSON

Status: Done — committed to main
Source: Claude Code session

Changed files:
- `src/services/pipeline/worker.py` — `ProcessResult` gets `translation_quality: str | None`; warning logs; `attachment_store: Path | None` param; `_process_attachments` saves to persistent path when store is set
- `src/services/pipeline/runner.py` — version creation gated on `_translation_was_no_op`; passes `attachment_store=settings.files_root/"attachments"` in `__main__`
- `src/services/api/routers/admin/ingestion.py` — `logger` added; warns when `source_language` is None at ingest time
- `frontend/src/features/documents/DocumentToolbar.tsx` — `useToast` + `r.ok` check in download handler
- `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.ts` / `he.ts` — `downloadError` key added
- `tests/unit/test_pipeline_runner.py` — 3 `ProcessResult` calls updated with `translation_quality`

Key invariant: a `document_translation_versions` record is now only created when `translated_text` is non-empty AND differs from `extracted_text`. The EML/archive fallback (empty translated → use extracted) is kept but no longer for same-text no-ops.

Remaining risk:
- `files_root/attachments/` files not GC'd on document delete
- `PdfViewer` loads via `pdfjsLib.getDocument(url)` without Bearer token — PDF in-viewer rendering still fails for auth-protected endpoint (separate issue)
- Scanned PDFs still need `ENABLE_OCR=true` for any text extraction

## 2026-05-25 — feat: parsers architecture — full file-type extraction & translation coverage

Status: Done — commit 0ec5226 on main
Source: Claude Code session

What changed:
- `src/services/extraction/mime_detector.py` — **new** MimeDetector (python-magic + mimetypes fallback)
- `src/services/extraction/opendocument.py` — **new** OdsExtractor + OdpExtractor
- `src/services/extraction/epub.py` — **new** EpubExtractor (ebooklib)
- `src/services/extraction/ocr.py` — **new** OcrExtractor (pytesseract + Pillow; `ENABLE_OCR=false`)
- `src/services/extraction/legacy_office.py` — **new** LegacyOfficeExtractor (LibreOffice subprocess; `ENABLE_LEGACY_OFFICE=false`)
- `src/services/extraction/language.py` — **new** LanguageDetector (langdetect; `ENABLE_LANGUAGE_DETECTION=true`)
- `src/services/extraction/registry.py` — alias map; ODS/ODP/EPUB registered; removed `octet-stream` fallback; feature-flagged OCR/LegacyOffice
- `src/services/extraction/plain.py` — charset-aware 3-step decode
- `src/services/extraction/pdf.py` — `ocr_fallback` flag + `_ocr_pdf()` helper
- `src/services/connectors/folder.py`, `smb.py` — use `detect_mime_type()` instead of `mimetypes.guess_type()`
- `src/services/pipeline/worker.py` — language detection injected; `lang_detector` + `enable_language_detection` constructor params
- `src/services/documents/repository.py` — `update_source_language()` added; `_row_to_model` maps `language_detected`
- `src/services/documents/models.py` — `language_detected: bool = False` on DocumentRow
- `src/shared/config.py` — `enable_ocr`, `enable_legacy_office`, `enable_language_detection` flags
- `src/services/pipeline/runner.py` — passes feature flags to ExtractorRegistry and PipelineWorker
- `migrations/versions/v6w7x8y9z0a1_add_language_detected_flag.py` — **new** `language_detected` bool column on documents
- `pyproject.toml` — added charset-normalizer, ebooklib, langdetect, python-magic; `[ocr]` optional group
- 14 new/updated test files (54 extraction unit tests total)

Verification:
- `ruff check` — clean
- `mypy --strict` — clean (29 source files)
- 54 unit tests — all passed

Open risks:
- `octet-stream` fallback removed — any connector explicitly setting `mime_type=application/octet-stream` now gets no extractor. MimeDetector mitigates this for folder/SMB.
- OCR/LibreOffice off by default; Docker image updates required before enabling.
- Migration `v6w7x8y9z0a1` adds `language_detected` column — additive, safe to roll back.

Next agent prompt:
- No open items. Pick up next issue from release queue in AGENTS.md.
- Optional follow-up: backfill job to re-process documents with empty `extracted_text` (previously unregistered MIME types).

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: EML translation version silently skipped on empty translator response

Status: Done — committed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Bug:** `runner.py::_run_process_job` guarded translation-version creation with
`if process_result.translated_text:`. `LibreTranslateClient.translate()` returns
`str(data["translatedText"])` from the JSON response — if LibreTranslate returns
`{"translatedText": ""}` (empty string) for a document with valid extracted content
(observed with EML files whose English headers bias auto-detection), `translated_text`
was falsy, so no `document_translation_versions` row was ever written and the UI
showed no translation.

**Fix:** One-line guard change in `runner.py`:
```python
_version_text = process_result.translated_text or process_result.extracted_text
if _version_text:
    ...update_version_status(..., translated_text=_version_text)
```
Falls back to `extracted_text` so the UI always receives something. Both empty → skip
(nothing to store). Also added `self._connection = None` to `_FakeJobRepo` so the
version-repo path can be properly patched in unit tests.

**Files changed:** `src/services/pipeline/runner.py`, `tests/unit/test_pipeline_runner.py`

**Verification:** 39 unit tests pass (runner, extraction, pipeline worker).

**Remaining:** Bug 2 (English-header bias in LibreTranslate auto-detection for EML)
is still open — body text should be passed separately from headers to avoid
misidentification. Not addressed in this fix.

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: Alembic multiple-heads on startup

Status: Done
Source: Claude Code session

**Symptom:** `migrate-1 | FAILED: Multiple head revisions are present for given argument 'head'`

**Root cause:** `2026_05_23_1200_pipeline_jobs_stage_rabbit.py` (`a1b2c3d4e5f6`) and
`v6w7x8y9z0a1_add_language_detected_flag.py` (`v6w7x8y9z0a1`) both descended from
`u5v6w7x8y9z0` — merged in separate branches without awareness of each other.

**Fix:** `migrations/versions/w7x8y9z0a1b2_merge_rabbit_and_language_flag.py` — empty
merge migration, `down_revision = ("a1b2c3d4e5f6", "v6w7x8y9z0a1")`. No schema changes.
The two forks touch disjoint tables (`pipeline_jobs` vs `documents`), so no conflict.

**Pattern to avoid:** When merging a feature branch that adds a migration, always run
`alembic heads` before the merge and add a merge migration if count > 1.

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: EML (and EPUB) parsed with wrong extractor due to libmagic generic result

Status: Done
Source: Claude Code session

**Symptom:** EML files "weren't parsed" (garbled content) and appeared to not exist in
the source documents view. EPUB files similarly could land on `ZipExtractor`.

**Root cause:** `MimeDetector.detect()` returned libmagic's result immediately for anything
non-`application/octet-stream`. libmagic classifies EML as `text/plain` (it's a text format)
and EPUB as `application/zip` (it's a ZIP). This caused `PlainExtractor` / `ZipExtractor`
to be used instead of `EmlExtractor` / `EpubExtractor`, and attachment extraction was
silently skipped (PlainExtractor has no `extract_attachments`).

**Fix:** `src/services/extraction/mime_detector.py` — after libmagic returns a *generic*
type (`text/plain`, `application/zip`, `application/octet-stream`), prefer
`mimetypes.guess_type` when it returns a more specific type for the file extension.
Non-generic libmagic results (e.g. `application/pdf` for a `.txt` file) are still trusted.

**Files changed:**
- `src/services/extraction/mime_detector.py` — `_GENERIC_TYPES` frozenset + fallback logic
- `tests/unit/test_extraction_mime_detector.py` — 2 new tests (EML and EPUB cases)

**Follow-up for "doesn't appear":** Likely dedup — EML docs were synced before the fix
with `mime_type=text/plain` and empty/garbled content. Delete those rows or trigger a
re-sync with content changes so SHA256 differs and `doc_repo.create()` re-creates them.

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: MIME alias/detection gaps for .yaml, .msg, .rst, .py, .js, .ts, .log, .toml

Status: Done
Source: Claude Code session — follow-up audit of EML fix

**Root cause:** Two complementary gaps:
1. `_ALIASES` in `registry.py` was missing several types that stdlib `mimetypes` emits
   (e.g. `application/yaml` for .yaml, `text/prs.fallenstein.rst` for .rst) and libmagic
   compound-document types for .msg (`application/CDFV2`, `application/x-ole-storage`).
2. `mimetypes` stdlib has no entry for `.msg`, `.log`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.toml` — these
   fell to `application/octet-stream` when libmagic was unavailable.

**Files changed:**
- `src/services/extraction/registry.py` — 9 new aliases added to `_ALIASES`
- `src/services/extraction/mime_detector.py` — 5 `mimetypes.add_type()` calls at module
  init to patch stdlib gaps (.msg → application/vnd.ms-outlook, .log/.ini/.conf → text/plain,
  .toml → application/toml)

**Intentional non-coverage:** `.7z`, `.rar`, `.odg`, `.odf`, `.gif` — no extractor exists
and adding one is out of scope. `.gz` (standalone, no .tar prefix) and `.bz2` similarly.

---

## 2026-05-25 — Feat: GenericExtractor fallback for unrecognised file types

Status: Done — commit dc02c66 on main
Source: Claude Code session

`ExtractorRegistry.extract()` now falls back to `GenericExtractor` instead of returning
`""` when no specific extractor matches. `GenericExtractor` tries UTF-8 then
charset-normalizer; it deliberately omits the latin-1 final step used by `PlainExtractor`
so binary files (images, executables) still produce `""` rather than garbage in the index.
`registry.get()` is unchanged — still returns `None` for unregistered types (used by
attachment extraction gating in `worker.py`).

**Files:** `src/services/extraction/generic.py` (new), `registry.py` (fallback wired in),
`tests/unit/test_extraction_registry.py` (updated + binary-safety test).

---

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: original document view showed translated content

Status: Done — commit 69c8aa3 on main
Source: Claude Code session

**Bug:** `PreviewPane.tsx` only threaded `showOriginal` in its first `if`-block
(extracted/translation/original+HTML). Plain text, CSV, Word, RTF, Markdown, and
code files fell through to per-mime branches that called `TextPreview`, `CodeViewer`,
and `MarkdownPreview` without the flag. Backend defaults `show_original=False`, so
those renderers silently returned translated content even when `activeMode === "original"`.

**Fix:** Pass `showOriginal={activeMode !== "translation"}` at every `TextPreview`,
`CodeViewer`, and `MarkdownPreview` callsite in `PreviewPane`. Added `showOriginal`
prop + `queryKey` slot to `CodeViewer` and `MarkdownPreview`. 88 unit tests pass.

**Files changed:** `PreviewPane.tsx`, `CodeViewer.tsx`, `MarkdownPreview.tsx`

---

## 2026-05-25 — Fix: auto-enrich fired on every document at index time

Status: Done — committed to main
Source: Claude Code session

**Bug:** `index_worker.py` called `publisher.publish_enrich()` unconditionally for every
document after indexing, bypassing the `auto_enrich_threshold` (default 5 views) entirely.

**Fix:** Removed 3 lines from `src/services/pipeline/index_worker.py` — the unconditional
`publish_enrich()` call after `publish_alert()`.

**Correct paths:**
- Auto-enrich: `PreviewService._maybe_auto_enrich()` fires from the `/preview/{document_id}`
  endpoint when `view_count >= threshold` and quality is not already `high`/`pending_high`.
- Manual enrich: `POST /documents/{document_id}/translate` → enqueues `enrich_document` job directly.

**Verification:** 31 unit tests pass (index worker, slow worker, rabbit client).

Next agent prompt:
- No open items from this session. Pick up next issue from AGENTS.md release queue.

## 2026-05-25 — Unit test suite cleanup

Status: Done — commits f4217a5, a8106d0, 09c300e on main
Source: Claude Code session

Result: 660 passed / 0 failed unit tests (was 638 / 21).

Key pattern established: **always pass `_env_file=None` to `Settings(...)` in unit tests**.
The project `.env` sets `FEATURE_MEILISEARCH_SEARCH=true`, `RABBITMQ_URL`, `EMBEDDING_URL`
and other container values — without `_env_file=None` these leak into every `Settings()` call
and break tests that expect code defaults or deleted env vars.

Other fixes:
- `alert_consumer.py::main()` now uses `build_encoder(settings)` instead of `DeterministicTestEncoder()`.
- Patch targets for lazily-imported modules must use the module path directly (e.g. `meilisearch.Client` not `services.api.main.meilisearch.Client`).
- Test fakes that back prod code accessing `_connection` must expose `_connection = None`.
- `STANDARD_VOLUMES` in `test_compose_volumes.py` updated to `ollama_llm_data` + `ollama_embed_data`.

Next agent prompt:
- Pick up next issue from release queue in AGENTS.md — no open items from this session.

## 2026-05-25 — Search + infra hardening sprint

Status: Done — all merged to main
Source: Claude Code session

What changed:
- `docker/ollama-llm.Dockerfile`, `docker/ollama-embed.Dockerfile` — new; split LLM and embed containers
- `docker-compose.yml` — `ollama` removed; `ollama-llm` + `ollama-embed` added with correct `depends_on`
- `src/shared/config.py` — `ollama_utility_model`, `ollama_reranker_model`, `effective_utility_model`, `effective_reranker_model`, `search_embedding_timeout`
- `src/services/search/factory.py` — `build_encoder(..., *, timeout=None)` override
- `src/services/api/routers/search.py` — pass `search_embedding_timeout` to encoder; fix `_map_sort` to resolve camelCase via `_MEILI_SORT_MAP` before appending direction
- `src/services/intelligence/worker.py`, `message_service.py`, `reranker.py`, `chat.py`, consumers — role-based model routing (utility/reranker)
- `frontend/src/api/expertise.ts`, `ExpertiseResult.tsx` — removed stale `comments` signal
- `tests/unit/test_model_routing.py` — 17 routing tests
- `tests/unit/test_search_factory.py` — 4 timeout override tests; `_env_file=None` fix
- `tests/unit/test_search_sort.py` — 10 parametrised `_map_sort` tests (new)
- `.env.example`, `.env.airgap.example` — `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT`, split Ollama vars

Verification:
- All new tests pass. Pre-existing coverage-threshold noise only.

Open risks:
- Operator must `docker compose build ollama-llm ollama-embed` on first deploy after the split.
- `ollama_data` volume not migrated automatically (models must be re-pulled).

Next agent prompt:
- Pick up next issue from release queue in AGENTS.md — no open items from this sprint.

## 2026-05-24 — Search improvements: facets, highlight rendering, instant search

Status: Done
Source: Claude Code session; commit 8dfa896 on `claude/refine-local-plan-ohFc5`

What changed:
- `src/services/search/models.py` — Added `SearchResults(results, facets)` frozen dataclass
- `src/services/search/meili_provider.py` — `search()` returns `SearchResults`; added `metadata.mime_type` to facets list; added `"title"` to `attributesToHighlight`; `_map_result()` prefers `_formatted.title`; extracts `facetDistribution` from raw response
- `src/services/api/schemas.py` — `SearchResponse.facets: dict[str, dict[str, int]] = Field(default_factory=dict)`
- `src/services/api/routers/search.py` — Unpacks `meili_results.results` / `.facets`; passes `facets=meili_facets` to `SearchResponse`
- `tests/unit/test_meili_provider.py` — Updated 2 tests: `len(response)` → `len(response.results)`, `response[0]` → `response.results[0]`
- `frontend/src/api/search.ts` — `SearchResponse.facets?: Record<string, Record<string, number>>`
- `frontend/src/features/search/FilterPanel.tsx` — Added `facets` prop; file type checkboxes show live counts; Tags + Source sections with facet-driven checkboxes (top 10); Source+Tags removed from Advanced (Extension stays)
- `frontend/src/features/search/SearchPage.tsx` — `useEffect` debounce 350ms on `inputValue`; passes `data?.facets ?? {}` to FilterPanel
- `frontend/src/features/search/ResultRow.tsx` — `highlightHtml()` sanitizer; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on title + snippet
- `frontend/src/features/search/ResultRow.module.css` — Mark highlight styles

Verification:
- Backend: 31/31 unit tests pass (`test_meili_provider`, `test_meili_search_path`) — no-cov
- Frontend: 28/28 tests pass (`FilterPanel.test.tsx`, `SearchPage.test.tsx`)
- `tsc --noEmit` — clean; `npm run build` — clean (756ms, 64 chunks)

Open risks:
- FilterPanel existing tests do not cover new Tags/Source sections (no test data for facets) — low risk since prop is optional and sections hidden when empty
- Instant search doesn't navigate (URL not updated until explicit submit) — by design

Next agent prompt:
- Open PR from `claude/refine-local-plan-ohFc5` targeting `main` if not already done.
- Consider adding a FilterPanel test that passes mock facets and asserts Tags/Source sections appear.

## 2026-05-24 — Frontend code splitting, Ollama fix, issue board cleanup, #480

Status: Done
Source: Claude Code session; commits 64a70ad, 4929569 on main

What changed:
- `frontend/src/app/routes.tsx` — all 18 static page imports → React.lazy()
- `frontend/src/app/AppLayout.tsx` — Outlet wrapped in `<Suspense fallback={null}>`
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` — manualChunks: vendor-react, vendor-router, vendor-query, vendor-pdf, vendor-highlight, vendor-markdown
- `src/services/search/encoder.py` — `_embed_batch()` passes `options.num_ctx = self._max_tokens` to Ollama /api/embed; 2 new unit tests in `test_search_ollama_encoder.py`
- `frontend/src/features/comments/CommentComposer.tsx` — Enter submits, Shift+Enter newline, hint text
- `frontend/src/features/annotations/AnnotationEditor.tsx` — same; handleSubmit extracted as onSubmit
- CSS modules (Comments.module.css, Annotations.module.css) — `.hint` class appended
- 4 new frontend tests covering Enter/Shift+Enter in both composers
- Issues: #365 closed, #482 closed, labels added to #480/481/482/438/511

Verification:
- `npm run build` — clean, 64 chunks, no errors
- `npm run typecheck` — clean
- `vitest run` (comments + annotations) — 8/8 passed
- Backend encoder unit tests — 10/10 passed

Open risks:
- `fallback={null}` on Suspense: brief blank flash on first visit to a route chunk (imperceptible on fast connection; can swap to skeleton if needed)
- #481 (threaded replies in comments) needs backend first: parent_id migration, repository, routes, then frontend. Do not start frontend-first.

Next agent prompt:
- Resume #400 AI workstreams: start A2 (hybrid RAG retrieval) — A1 already merged.
- Or pick up #501 (Rust workspace scaffold) — all sub-issues #501–#510 are `status:next`.

## 2026-05-23 — RabbitMQ job bus merged + QoL improvements

Status: Done
Source: OpenCode session; issues #425–#432, #482

What changed:
- RabbitMQ job bus (#432) merged to main via PR #512: 7-stage pipeline, 6 workers, admin monitoring, retry tiers, air-gap support
- Related documents (#482): structured reasons with expandable "Why related?" panel
- Translation auto-detect: TranslateConsumer passes None to LibreTranslate; admin source default no longer forces "en"
- Download: fetch() with JWT auth replaces raw <a> link (was downloading 401 JSON). Supports original + translated text with clear error guidance
- TranslateConsumer: creates document_translation_versions records so frontend shows translation view mode
- EnrichConsumer: RabbitMQ stage for auto_enrich high-quality re-translation
- Pipeline efficiency: batch encoding (encode_batch), ThreadPoolExecutor for intelligence + map-reduce, model caching (OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=4h, MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2)
- DB-poll split: when RABBITMQ_ENABLED=true, process_document job marked succeeded immediately — only RabbitMQ pipeline processes documents (no duplicate work)
- Ollama: better prompts (JSON format, examples), temp 0.2, embedding timeout 180s, model caching
- Boolean SQL fixes: 5 instances fixed + lint script + PostgreSQL CI job
- UI: full-width, live duration, 7-stage pipeline order, reason pills
- CI: ruff/mypy clean, 13 rabbit unit tests, CI split for PostgreSQL

Open risks:
- PostgreSQL CI job 20min timeout — may need further splitting if test suite grows
- Old pipeline_worker test removed (test_index_worker.py) — new workers have no unit tests
- SMB original file download broken when temp files deleted after sync (translated .txt works)

Next agent prompt:
- Sub #501: Cargo workspace scaffold + CI for Rust vector worker

## 2026-05-23 — Pipeline optimizations, UI full-width, prompt improvements

Status: Done
Source: OpenCode session

What changed:
- `src/services/pipeline/vector_worker.py` — batch encoding via `encode_batch()`
- `src/services/pipeline/worker.py` — batch encoding via `encode_batch()`; `_FakeEncoder` mock updated
- `src/services/intelligence/worker.py` — ThreadPoolExecutor for tasks + map-reduce; better fallback prompts; empty summary fallback to first sentence
- `src/services/pipeline/jobs.py` — `_sanitize_error` includes first line of `str(exc)`
- `src/services/intelligence/ollama_client.py` — timeout 120→300s
- `src/services/search/encoder.py` — embed timeout 60→180s, configurable via `embedding_timeout`
- `src/shared/config.py` — `embedding_timeout` field added
- `src/services/search/factory.py` — passes `embedding_timeout` to encoder
- `.env` — `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=4h`, `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2`

- Frontend CSS: admin pages/expertise/history/notifications — `max-width` removed, `width: 100%`
- Search results: `max-width` 980→1200px
- Document table columns: 42%/8%/6%/18%/auto for full-width
- Duration column: live ticking via 1s interval
- `src/features/admin/AdminSourceDetailPage.tsx` — `useRef` ticker for live duration

Verification: ruff clean, 12/12 intelligence tests, 12/13 pipeline worker (1 pre-existing), typecheck clean, build passes

## 2026-05-22 — In-document search fix tests verified and closed (#469)

Status: Done
Source: issue #469; commits 2927a50 (fix) + 48153a9 (tests) on feature/document-chat + main

What changed:
- Verified existing fix (2927a50): all renderers receive search props, PdfViewer page-jump, virtualized cumulative offsets.
- Added missing tests (48153a9):
  - PreviewPane: search prop passing verified for all renderer paths (text/plain, DOCX/RTF, extracted, PDF, table, archive, email, slides, code)
  - PdfViewer: activeSearchIndex navigates to page containing the match
  - ArchivePreview: match highlighting + count via onMatchCountChange
  - EmailPreview (new file): match highlighting + count
  - SlidesPreview (new file): cross-slide match count
  - TablePreview: cell highlighting + match count
  - TextPreview: virtualized global active-match index stability
  - DocumentPage: Ctrl+F opens search for text, suppressed for image/audio/video

Verification:
- `tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `ruff check`, `mypy` — backend unaffected (frontend-only change)

Open risks:
- Frontend test suite not run locally (Node 20.9.0) — resolved: Node 22 default as of 2026-05-23
- SQLite does not enforce FK cascade (messages persist after session delete in test DB); documented in test comment; Postgres enforces correctly in production

#473 recommendation: **Ready to close** — Phase B backend + frontend + tests are complete. B7 added router hardening, lifecycle coverage, cross-user isolation tests, and degraded RAG fallback. No Phase C/D/E/F scope was touched.

Next agent prompt:
- Phase C: scope model, `ChatScope` filter UI, `ScopeBadge` component, InsightPane migration from legacy QAPanel to ChatWindow. Branch off `feature/document-chat`.

## 2026-05-21 — Document Chat Phase B6 frontend complete

Status: Done

What changed:
- `frontend/src/api/chat.ts` — typed API client for all /chat/* endpoints
- `frontend/src/features/chat/` — ChatPage, ChatSidebar, ChatWindow, ChatInput,
  MessageList, MessageBubble, ChatCitationCard, ChatCitationList (all new)
- `frontend/src/app/routes.tsx` — `/chat` route added
- `frontend/src/components/layout/NavRail.tsx` — "Chat" nav item (MessagesSquare icon)
- `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.ts` + `he.ts` — nav.chat + full chat section strings
- `frontend/src/features/chat/ChatPage.test.tsx` — 11 test cases

Key design decisions:
- Session messages managed in local state after initial query seed (prevents refetch flash)
- Seeded once per session via ref guard; staleTime=5m on session query
- User message optimistically added; replaced by server user+assistant turn on success
- citation_id used as React key (fallback: `${document_id}-${chunk_index ?? idx}`)
- TanStack Query v5: useEffect used instead of onSuccess on useQuery

Verification:
- `tsc --noEmit` — exit 0
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23: nvm default → v22)
- `npm run lint` — same Node gap blocks formatter output

Open risks:
- Vitest/ESLint now work on Node 22; CI must use compatible version
- `MessagesSquare` icon from lucide-react — confirm it exists in the pinned version at CI time
- Phase C InsightPane migration not yet done; InsightPane still shows legacy QAPanel

Next agent prompt:
- B7 integration tests: full session lifecycle, cross-user 403, degraded Qdrant fallback
- Then Phase C: scope model, ChatScope filter, ScopeBadge, InsightPane migration

## 2026-05-21 — Phase B1-B2 chat_sessions + chat_messages migrations

Status: Done
Source: issue #473

What changed:
- Created `k1l2m3n4o5p6_add_chat_sessions_table.py` — `chat_sessions` with id, user_id (FK CASCADE), title, scope_type, scope_ids (JSON as Text), created_at, updated_at, archived_at, metadata (JSON as Text). Indexes on user_id and updated_at.
- Created `q7r8s9t0u1v2_add_chat_messages_table.py` — `chat_messages` with id, session_id (FK CASCADE to chat_sessions), role, content, rewritten_query, citations (JSON as Text), retrieval_trace, model, latency_ms, created_at, metadata. Index on (session_id, created_at).
- JSON fields use `sa.Text()` with JSON-serialized defaults for SQLite compat (project convention — no CheckConstraints, app-layer validation).

Verification:
- `ruff check` + `ruff format` — passed
- `pytest tests/test_migrations.py` — 5 passed (all existing migration smoke tests + new tables created successfully)

Open risks:
- JSON-in-Text fields need app-layer encoding/decoding (ChatRepository handles this)
- No check constraint on `role` — app-layer validation required

Next mission:
- B3 ChatRepository

## 2026-05-21 — Document Chat Phase A foundation complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #472

What changed:
- Added `citation_id` UUID to backend `Citation` model (auto-generated via `uuid4` default factory).
- Included `citation_id` in `/qa` response serialization.
- Added `chunk_index`, `source_id`, `citation_id` to `QACitation` TypeScript type.
- Fixed `CitationList` React key collision: `key={c.citation_id ?? `${c.document_id}-${c.chunk_index ?? idx}`}`.
- Replaced 1-sentence grounding prompt with 8-rule prompt per Document Chat design spec.

Verification:
- `ruff check` + `ruff format` — passed
- `mypy` — 3 source files, no issues
- `pytest tests/unit/test_rag_retrieval_eval.py tests/unit/test_rag_reranker.py` — 18 passed
- `tsc --noEmit` — exit 0
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23)

Open risks:
- Frontend test suite now runs locally on Node 22; CI should confirm

Next agent prompt:
- Phase B (persistent chat sessions) after PR #472 merges.

## 2026-05-21 — #449 in-document search complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #449, PR #462

What changed:
- Added `DocumentSearchBar.tsx` (`type="search"` input for `searchbox` ARIA role): debounced query, N of M counter, Prev/Next nav, Escape closes, Shift+Enter → Prev, `aria-live="polite"` counter.
- Added `highlightMatches.tsx`: shared utility returning `{nodes, count}` with `<mark data-match-index>` elements; active match gets distinct CSS class. `countMatches()` for non-rendered count (PDF).
- `DocumentPage`: Ctrl+F/Cmd+F toggles search bar; 200ms debounce; `searchable` computed (excludes image/audio/video/archive); search state threaded to PreviewPane.
- `DocumentToolbar`: search toggle button with `aria-pressed`; shown when `searchable && onSearchToggle`.
- `TextPreview` + `CodeViewer`: highlight matches inline, scroll active mark into view.
- `PdfViewer`: extracts text from all pages via `getTextContent()`, reports match count via `onMatchCountChange`.
- `TablePreview`: CSS class on matching cells.
- `frontend/src/test/setup.ts`: added `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = vi.fn()` for jsdom.

Verification:
- 77/77 targeted tests (DocumentSearchBar 13, DocumentToolbar 14, TextPreview, CodeViewer, PdfViewer). TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- `scrollIntoView` for active match not verified in real browser; jsdom mock confirms call path only.
- PdfViewer match highlighting is count-only (no visual marks in canvas-rendered PDF).

Next agent prompt:
- Check parent issue #453 for remaining MVP child issues after #449.

## 2026-05-21 — #448 media viewer complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #448, PR #461

What changed:
- Added `MediaPreview.tsx`: native `<audio controls>` / `<video controls>` (16:9 container). `onError` → `UnsupportedPreview`. Metadata row (title, MIME). Transcript section (`<h3>`) shown when `snippet` non-empty.
- Backend download route: added `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, `Range` request parsing, 206 Partial Content response. `Content-Disposition` changed to `inline` for browser playback.
- PreviewPane: `audio/*` and `video/*` prefix dispatch added before image branch.

Verification:
- 16/16 MediaPreview tests. 2 new PreviewPane dispatch tests. 185/185 full suite. TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- Backend byte-range handling not covered by existing tests; only manually verified via code review.
- `Content-Disposition: inline` change affects non-media downloads too (all MIME types now inline).

Next agent prompt:
- Merge PR #461 into `feature/document-viewer`.
- Start #449 (In-document search). Branch `feat/449-in-document-search` from `feature/document-viewer`.

## 2026-05-21 — #447 code/syntax viewer complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #447, PR #460

What changed:
- Added `CodeViewer.tsx` using highlight.js core (bundled; json, xml, yaml, python, js, ts, bash, sql languages registered). Fetches via `getDocumentText` with limit 50,000.
- Line numbers in a sticky-left `aria-hidden` gutter. Copy button (`aria-label="Copy code"`). Raw toggle, word-wrap toggle.
- Truncation notice shown when `data.truncated=true`.
- Language detection: MIME lookup → file extension from `title` → `"plaintext"` fallback (skips hljs).
- Container `role="region"` + `aria-label="Code: {title}"`.
- PreviewPane: `application/json` moved from TextPreview to CodeViewer; `CODE_MIMES` set added covering xml/yaml/source types; `text/plain`/`text/markdown` remain on TextPreview.

Verification:
- 19/19 CodeViewer tests. 3 new PreviewPane dispatch tests. 167/167 full suite. TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- highlight.js GitHub theme (github.min.css) is always light; no dark-mode variant wired.
- Gutter line-count comes from splitting raw text by "\n"; a file without a trailing newline has one fewer gutter line than the tokenized output.

Next agent prompt:
- Merge PR #460 into `feature/document-viewer`.
- Start #448 (Media viewer). Branch `feat/448-media-viewer` from `feature/document-viewer`.

## 2026-05-21 — #445 metadata Details tab complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #445, PR #459

What changed:
- Extended `PreviewResponse` (backend) with `source_language`, `target_language`, `status`, `content_sha256`, `created_at`, `updated_at` (all `str | None`).
- Added those fields as optional to `DocumentPreview` TypeScript interface.
- Created `DetailsTab.tsx` — `<dl>` component with 25+ MIME label mappings, file size (B/KB/MB), source/path from metadata, languages, translation quality badge, status badge, version + latest marker, timestamps, SHA-256 (12-char truncated + copy button).
- Created `DetailsTab.module.css` with badge, code, hashGroup, copyBtn styles.
- Added `"details"` to `InsightPaneTab` union; added `tabDetails` i18n key to en + he locales.
- Updated `InsightPane` to accept `preview?: DocumentPreview` and render DetailsTab.
- Updated `DocumentPage` to pass `preview` to InsightPane.
- Deleted `DetailsPanel.tsx` (unused).

Verification:
- 19/19 DetailsTab tests passed. Full documents suite 145/145. TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- None critical. SHA-256 copy feedback is a 2-second "Copied" flash — no fallback for clipboard API denial.

Next agent prompt:
- Merge PR #459 into `feature/document-viewer`.
- Start #447 (Code/syntax viewer). Branch `feat/447-code-viewer` from `feature/document-viewer`.

## 2026-05-21 — #444 image viewer complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #444, PR #458

What changed:
- Added `ImageViewer.tsx` with zoom 25%–400%, pan, keyboard controls (+/-/0/arrows), Ctrl+scroll, double-click fit reset.
- TIFF → UnsupportedPreview; load error → ExtractionFailedPreview; SVG as `<img>` (no inline SVG).
- Image info bar shows dimensions + zoom level.
- Keyboard help in visually-hidden `<p>`.
- Zoom state lifted to DocumentPage (`imageZoom`, `setImageZoom`); toolbar shows zoom controls when `showImageControls=true`.
- PreviewPane now passes `imageZoom`/`onImageZoomChange` to ImageViewer.
- ImagePreview.tsx deleted.

Verification:
- 264/264 tests passed (50 test files). TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- Ctrl+scroll preventDefault called on React synthetic event — needs browser test to verify scroll is suppressed in the container.
- Pan boundary clamping not implemented; image can be panned off-screen.

Next agent prompt:
- Merge PR #458 into `feature/document-viewer`.
- Start #445 (Metadata Details tab). Branch `feat/445-metadata-tab` from `feature/document-viewer`.

## 2026-05-21 — #443 view mode switcher complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #443, PR #457

What changed:
- Added `ViewModeSwitcher.tsx` — segmented button group (original/extracted/translation); hidden when ≤1 mode available.
- Added `FidelityStatusBar.tsx` — single-line strip with colour dot + accessible aria-label + fidelity text; sits between toolbar and viewer body in `DocumentPage`.
- `DocumentPage`: replaced `showOriginal` state with `activeMode` (ViewMode); derives showOriginal; defaults to `translation` if available translations exist; resets on docId change.
- `DocumentToolbar`: added `availableModes`/`activeMode`/`onModeChange` props; renders ViewModeSwitcher in controls.
- `PreviewPane`: added `activeMode`/`selectedVersionId` props; extracted/translation modes override MIME dispatch to TextPreview; HTML and images always rendered natively.

Verification:
- 236/236 tests passed (49 test files). TypeScript clean.
- New tests: 6 ViewModeSwitcher + 10 FidelityStatusBar + 4 new PreviewPane + 5 new DocumentPage.

Open risks:
- FidelityStatusBar doesn't cover red/grey dot states (file unavailable, no preview) — those require server flag not yet available.
- `converted` preview mode wired to #446; skipped per issue spec.

Next agent prompt:
- Merge PR #457 into `feature/document-viewer`.
- Check #453 for the next remaining child issue in the MVP track.

## 2026-05-21 — #442 PDF.js viewer complete; #443 view mode switcher next

Status: Done
Source: issue #442, PR #456

What changed:
- Added `PdfViewer.tsx` using `pdfjs-dist` with canvas rendering, page nav, zoom, loading state, and `ExtractionFailedPreview` on failure.
- Worker configured via `pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs?url` — local bundled asset, no CDN.
- `PreviewPane` dispatches `application/pdf` to `PdfViewer` (was TextPreview).
- Added `PreviewPane.test.tsx` and `PdfViewer.test.tsx`.

Verification:
- Frontend: 18/18 tests passed. TypeScript clean.
- jsdom logs canvas `getContext` not-implemented warnings — expected, guarded in component.

Open risks:
- Page/zoom controls are inside `PdfViewer` for this PR; #443 may want to move them to `DocumentToolbar`.
- Text layer not enabled yet (canvas-only rendering); browser find-in-page won't work until added.
- Canvas rendering is not verified in jsdom tests — needs manual/browser test.

Next agent prompt:
- Branch `feat/443-view-mode-switcher` from `feature/document-viewer` after PR #456 merges.
- Read mission for issue #443 (`docs/agents/missions/` if it exists).
- If moving PDF controls to DocumentToolbar, thread state up from PdfViewer via ref or callback.

## 2026-05-21 — #441 full text API complete; #442 PDF.js viewer next

Status: Done
Source: issue #441, PR #455, issue #442

What changed:
- Added `GET /documents/{document_id}/text` (offset/limit pagination, show_original, translation_version_id).
- Added `PreviewService.get_full_text()` in `src/services/preview/service.py`.
- Added `getDocumentText()` in `frontend/src/api/documents.ts`.
- Updated `TextPreview` to fetch in 10K chunks with loading state and "Load more".
- Updated `PreviewPane` to pass `docId` to `TextPreview` for all text dispatches.
- Created `feature/document-viewer` integration branch on remote.

Verification:
- Backend: 9/9 integration tests passed (`tests/integration/test_document_text_api.py`).
- Frontend: 9/9 unit tests passed (`TextPreview.test.tsx`). TypeScript clean.

Open risks:
- PDF dispatch in PreviewPane still goes to TextPreview; #442 must change it to PdfViewer.
- `TextPreview` `text` prop is now optional — any caller not on `docId` path still works via static fallback.
- Coverage floor (90%) only enforced on full suite run; targeted test runs will show coverage failure.

Next agent prompt:
- Branch `feat/442-pdfjs-viewer` from `feature/document-viewer` after PR #455 merges.
- Read mission `docs/agents/missions/issue-442-pdfjs-viewer.md`.
- Verify #441 is present on `feature/document-viewer` before starting (check `getDocumentText` exists in `frontend/src/api/documents.ts`).
- PR must target `feature/document-viewer`, not `main`.

## 2026-05-21 — #450 a11y, performance, and telemetry hardening complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #450, PR #464

What changed:
- A11y: download link aria-label in DocumentToolbar; table aria-label + th scope="col" in TablePreview; sr-only status text in FidelityStatusBar; focus management on view mode switch and search close in DocumentPage.
- Perf: TextPreview virtualized with react-window v2 `List` when >10K lines (22px row height, max 600px); TablePreview virtualized with ARIA role-based table when >1K rows (32px row height).
- Telemetry: viewer.text/pdf/image.load event names added to performanceTelemetry.ts; named timers in TextPreview/PdfViewer/ImageViewer.
- Backend: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff on both full and range download responses.
- Test infrastructure: ResizeObserver global mock added to test setup (react-window v2 requirement); archive traversal unit tests for ZIP/TAR ".." paths; nosniff integration test.

Verification:
- 359/359 frontend tests passed (54 files). TypeScript clean.
- 7/7 archive extraction tests passed. 1 nosniff integration test passed.
- Lint: no new errors (only pre-existing).

Open risks:
- Virtualization tests limited in jsdom (no layout measurement) — browser-based verification deferred to #451 follow-up.
- Virtualized TablePreview uses ARIA roles instead of native `<table>` — tradeoff required by react-window.

Next agent prompt:
- Check parent issue #453 for remaining MVP child issues.
- If picking up #451 (browser-based test verification), note that virtualization rendering can only be verified in a real browser with layout.

## 2026-05-22 — #488 document relationships complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #488; PR #496 (targeting feature/document-details-and-search); commit c3cd4a0 on 488-document-relationships

What changed:
- Migration: `document_relationships` table with unique constraint on (parent, child).
- `DocumentRelationshipRepository`: create_relationship (idempotent), get_relationships (UNION both directions).
- Pipeline: worker records `email_attachment` or `archive_child` relationships after child doc creation.
- PreviewResponse extended with `relationships` field.
- DetailsTab: "Source context" section with parent/child badges + linked titles.

Verification:
- ruff/mypy/tsc clean; 7 unit + 3 integration tests pass.
- Branch targets feature/document-details-and-search.

Open risks:
- Relationship population only happens for newly ingested docs (no retroactive backfill).
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23)

Next agent prompt:
- Pick up #483 (expand details panel) or #484 (advanced search).

## 2026-05-22 — #487 unify comments into annotations complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #487; PR #495 (targeting feature/document-details-and-search); commit aa5f32e on 487-unify-comments-annotations

What changed:
- Migration: `annotation_replies` table + INSERT comments as document-level annotations (position=NULL).
- Annotation replies: list_replies, create_reply, delete_reply (soft), can_modify_reply; reply_count in list_annotations.
- Reply API: GET/POST /annotations/{id}/replies, DELETE /annotation-replies/{id}.
- Comments router: all endpoints return 410 Gone.
- Frontend: removed comments tab from InsightPane; AnnotationItem gains inline reply list/composer.

Verification:
- ruff/mypy clean; 9 unit + 11 integration + 9 existing + 5 migration = 34 backend tests pass; tsc clean.

Open risks:
- Comment i18n keys are now dead (no harm).
- Branch targets feature/document-details-and-search.
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23)

Next agent prompt:
- Pick up #488 (document relationships) or #483 (expand details panel).

## 2026-05-22 — #486 user-managed private/public document tags complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #486; PR #494 (targeting feature/document-details-and-search); commit a9dc372 on 486-user-tags

What changed:
- Migration: `user_document_tags` table with indexes on (document_id, user_id) and (document_id, is_private).
- `UserDocumentTagRepository`: list_tags (own private + all public), create_tag (max 50/user/doc, dup check), delete_tag (ownership or admin).
- API: GET/POST/DELETE `/documents/{id}/user-tags` — all behind `assert_doc_access`.
- `UserTagEditor` component: chip list (private dim, public accent-tinted), inline input + Add, Enter support, Private/Public radio, delete on owned tags, error state.
- Wired into `DetailsTab` as "My Tags" section; `docId` from `InsightPane`.

Verification:
- `ruff check` + `ruff format` — clean
- `mypy --strict` — no issues (3 source files)
- `pytest tests/unit/test_user_document_tags.py --no-cov` — 16 passed
- `pytest tests/integration/test_user_tags_api.py --no-cov` — 17 passed
- `pytest tests/test_migrations.py --no-cov` — 4 passed
- `tsc --noEmit` — clean
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23)

Open risks:
- Frontend vitest not run locally — CI is sole gate for UserTagEditor.test.tsx.
- Branch targets `feature/document-details-and-search`, not `main`.

Next agent prompt:
- Pick up #487 (unify comments into annotations) or #488 (document relationships).

## 2026-05-22 — #485 Markdown preview complete

Status: Done
Source: issue #485; PR #493 (targeting feature/document-details-and-search); commit 3b5a592 on 485-markdown-preview

What changed:
- `MarkdownPreview` renderer: fetches via `getDocumentText` (100K limit), marked + DOMPurify sanitization, Raw/Rendered toggle, Copy button, loading/error/fallback states.
- Wired into `PreviewPane`: MIME dispatch + extension fallback for `.md`/`.markdown`/`.mdown`.
- 13 MarkdownPreview tests + updated PreviewPane dispatch tests.

Verification:
- `tsc --noEmit` — clean
- (Node 20.9.0 resolved globally 2026-05-23)

Open risks:
- Frontend vitest now runnable locally on Node 22.

## 2026-05-20 — Agent skills and memory branch

Status: Done
Source: project manager chat summary

What changed:
- Started branch `chore/add-agent-skill-pack`.
- Added shared Claude/OpenCode skills under `.claude/skills/`.
- Added shared memory policy and seed memory files.

Verification:
- File creation verified through GitHub connector commit responses.

Open risks:
- OpenCode agent definitions still need final creation and review.
- No local runtime validation was run.

Next agent prompt:
- Review branch `chore/add-agent-skill-pack` for skill discoverability, OpenCode agent syntax, and memory policy clarity.
