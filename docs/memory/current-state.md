# Tomorrowland Current State

Canonical shared memory for active project state. Keep this file compact and factual.

## 2026-05-20 — Shared agent skills setup

Status: Active
Source: project manager chat summary

Finding:
- Add a shared `.claude/skills/` skill library for Claude Code and OpenCode.
- Add project-local OpenCode agent definitions under `.opencode/agents/`.
- Add repo-owned Markdown memory under `docs/memory/`.

Impact:
- Future agent work should load only the relevant skills and memory files before broad repo exploration.
- Project memory should be easy to review in git.

Next action:
- Finish wiring skills, memory files, and OpenCode agent definitions.
